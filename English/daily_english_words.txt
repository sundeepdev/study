Day 1:

-  twiddle, knob, in sight, glazed expression

   Faced with an instrument like this, students typically respond either by twiddling every knob and pressing every button in sight, or by adopting a glazed expression.

Day 2:

-  comic strip expletive

   ubiquitous strings of punctuation representing a regular expression: /^ (?:To:)\s*(\S*)$/—not comic strip expletives

Day 9:

    -   Prominent

        Prominent Putin opponent shot dead

    -   Deputy

        He was deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin.

    -   Condemn

        Putin condemned the killing of Nemtsov.

    -   Condolences

        The Russian President expresses deep condolences to the near and dear of Boris Nemtsov
        who died tragically.

    -   Rally

        Nemtsov's death comes two days before a large opposition rally is set to take place in
        Moscow.

    -   Embezzle

        He claimed that up to 60% of the final cost had been embezzled.

    -   Marginalize

        Nemtsov used to be powerful but had been marginalized since Putin was elected.

Day 10

    -   Induction

        There three versions of this principle, known as the principle of induction, the principle of strong
        induction and the well-ordering principle.

Day 11

    -   Forgo

        To produce more pizza we must produce less cola. The opportunity cost of producing an additional pizza
        is the cola we must forgo.

    -   Notwithstanding

        Asia’s strong demand for food imports has contributed to this increase, notwithstanding
        bumper harvests.

Day 12

    -   Spottily

        Books about programming languages often cover only the first two, or discuss usage only spottily.

    -   paramount

        Clarity and simplicity are of paramount importance.

    -   slavishly

        You should not slavishly follow these rules, the violate them only occasionally and with good reason.

Day 13

    -   Preclude

        The JavaBeans pattern precludes the possibility of making a class immutable.

    -   Fraught

        The traditional Abstract Factory implementation in Java has been the Class object, with the newInstance
        method playing the part of the build method. This usage is fraught with problems.

    -   Propagate

        Also, the newInstance method propagates any exception thrown by the parameterless constructor, even though
        newInstance lacks the corresponding throws clauses.

    -   Elusive

        Like most concurrency bugs, bugs that cause liveness failures can be elusive because they depend on 
        the relative timing of events in different threads, and therefore do not always manifest themselves
        in development or testing.

    -   Subsume

        Performance issues subsume a broad range of problems, including poor service time...

    -   Rivets and I-beams

        Building bridges that don't fall down requires the correct use of a lot of rivets and ibeams.

    -   Retrofit

        It is far easier to design a class to be thread-safe than to retrofit it for thread safety later.

Day 14

    -   Mock

        it's impossible to substitute a mock implementation for a singleton unless it implements
        an interface that serves as its type(??)

    -   Caveat

        Nothing that a client can change this, with one caveat:...

    -   Ironclad

        It provides an ironclad guarantee against multiple instantiation.

    -   Clutter up

        This is unnecessary and it clutters up the program.

    -   Norm     

        Nulling out object references should be the exception rather than the norm.

Day 15

    -   Pop Your Cherry

        Peter tells me you're popping your cherry with this.

    -   Pop a squat

        All right, homeboy. Pop a squat

    -   Convertible

        This stuff you are signing give you the convertible note for funding.

    -   Shit-ton

        You know how sea turtles have a shit-ton of babies.

    -   technicality

        A lot of these guys come in here and they can do all the engineering stuff but they get all 
        hung up on technicalities. They just cannot tell you what their vision for the company is.

    -   halve

        It's like you need both halves of the brain, right?

    -   bait

        The whose house smells like a bait station.

    -   recap

        Richard, I'm just gonna recap for a second.

    -   Freeballing.

        This is the type of evening that requires freeballing.

    -   liven

        Our startup sources actors to parties to liven things up.

    -   orgy

        Welcome to the Peter Gregory foundation's fourth annual orgy of caring.

Day 16  

    -   erratic

        Their use can cause erratic behavior.

    -   grave

        It is a grave error to depend on a finilizer to close files.

    -   tardy

        If many files are left open because the JVM is tardy in executing finilizers, a program
        may fail because it can no longer open files.

    -   likewise

         The behavior of a program that depends on the promptness of finilizer execution may likewise vary.

    -   odds(different from odd)

        They may increase the odds of finilizers getting executed, but they don't guarantee it.
