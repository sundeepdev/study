    An outline is a line that is drawn around elements (outside the borders)    to make the element "stand out".

    However, the outline property is different from the border property.

    The outline is not a part of an element's dimensions; the element's 
    total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

    outline-color   Sets the color of an outline
