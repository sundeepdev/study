    With CSS float, an element can be pushed to the left or right, allowing other elements
    to wrap around it. Flot is often used with images, but it is also useful when working
    with layouts.

    -   How Elements Float

        Elements are floated horizontally, this means that an element can only be floated left or
        right, not up or down. 

        A floated element will move as far to the left or right as it can. Usually this means all
        the way to the left or right to the containing element.

        The elements after the floating element will flow around it.

        The elements before the floating element will not be affected.

        If an image is floated to the right, a following text flows around it, to the left:

        Example:

        img {
            float: right;
        }
*/
