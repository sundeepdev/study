    HTML Attributes

        -   HTML elements can have attributes
        -   Attributes provide additional info about an element
        -   Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        -   Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

    -   The lang Attribute

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en-US">
        <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>

        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

        </body>
        </html>
   
    -   The title Attribute

        <p title="About W3Schools">
        W3Schools is a web developer's site.
        It provides tutorials and references covering
        many aspects of web programming,
        including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, ASP, etc.
        </p>

    -   The href Attribute

        HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:

        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

    -   Size Attributes

        HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

        The filename of the source(src), and the size of the image(width and height) are all provided
        as attributes:

        <img src="w3schools.jpg" width="104" height="142"> 

    -   The alt Attribute

        The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an HTML element cannot be
        displayed. The value of the attribute can be read by "screen readers". This way, someone "
        listening" to the webpage, i.e. a blind person, can "hear" the element.

        <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

    -   the disabled Attribute

        Specifies that an input element should be disabled

    -   the id Attribute

        Specifies a unique id for an element.

    -   the src Attribute

        Specifies the URL (web address) for an image

    -   the style Attribute

        Specifies the inline CSS style for an element

    -   the title Attribute

        Specifies extra info about an element (displayed as a tool tip)

    -   the value Attribute

        Specifies the value (text content) for an input element.

    -   We suggest: Always use lowercase attributes

    -   We suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values

        The following title will not be displayed properly:        
    
        <p title=About W3Schools>

    -   Single or Double Quotes?

        Both can be used. In some situations, when the attribut  value itself contains double quotes, 
        it is necessary to use single quotes:

        Example:

        <p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>

        Or vice versa:

        <p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
