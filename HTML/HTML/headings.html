-   HTML Headings

    Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

    <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines 
    the least important heading.

-   Headings are important

    Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings 
    to make text BIG or bold.

    Search engines use your headings to index the structure 
    and content of your web pages. 

    Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important 
    to use headings to show the document structure.

-   HTML Horizontal Rules

    The <hr> tag creates a horizontal line in an HTML page.
    The hr element can be used to seperate content:
    
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
