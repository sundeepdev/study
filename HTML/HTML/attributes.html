    Attributes provide additional information about HTML
    elements.

    -   HTML Attributes

        -   HTML elements can have attributes
        -   Attributes provide additional information about an element
        -   Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
        -   Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

    -   The Lang Attribute

        The language is declared in the lang attribute.

        Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications 
        (screen readers) and search engines:

    -   The title Attribute

        HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.
    
        In this example, the <p> element has a title attribute. The value
        of the attribute is "About W3Schools":

        When you move the mouse over the element, the title will be 
        displayed as a tooltip.

    -   The href Attribute

        HTML links are defined with the <a> tag. The link address is
        specified in the href attribute.

    -   Size Attributes

        HTML images are defined with the <img> tag. The filename of the
        source(src), and the size of the image(width and height) are
        all provided as attributes:

    -   The alt Attribute

        The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when
        an HTML element cannot be displayed. The value of the attribute
        can be read by "screen readers". This way, someone "listening" 
        to the webpage, i.e. blind person, can "hear" the element.

    -   We Suggest: Always use lowercase attributes

        The HTML 5 standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
        The title attribute can be written with upper or lower case like
        Title and/or TITLE.

        W3C recommends lowercase in HTML4, and demands lowercase for
        stricter types like XHTML.

        Note: Lower case is the most common. Lower case is easier to 
        type. At W3Schools we always use lower case attribute names.

    -   We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values

        The HTML5 standard does not require quotes around attribute 
        values. The href attribute, demonstrated above, can be written as:

        <a href=http://www.w3schools.com>

        W3C recommends quotes in HTML4, and demands quotes for stricter 
        document types like XHTML.

        Sometimes it is necessary to use quotes. This will not display 
        correctly, because it contains a space:

        Using quotes are the most common. Omitting quotes can produce errors.       At W3Schools we always use quotes around attribute values.

    -   Single or Double Quotes?

        Double style quotes are the most common in HTML, but single 
        style can also be used.

        In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains 
        double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

        Example
        <p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>

        Or vice versa:

        Example

        <p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">

    -   HTML Attributes

        Below is an alphabetical list of some attributes often used
        in HTML:

        Attribute           Description
        alt                 Specifies an alternative text for an image
        disabled            Specifies that an input element should be
                            disabled.
        id                  Specifies a unique id for an element
        src                 Specifies the URL (web address) for an image
        style               Specifies an inline CSS style for an element
        title               Specifies extra information about an element
                            (displayed as a tool tip)
        value               Specifies the value(text content) for an input
                            element.
