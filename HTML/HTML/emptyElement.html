    Empty HTML Elements

    HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

    <br> is an empty element without a closing tag(the <br> tag
    defines a link break).

    Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this <br />.
    
    HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you need
    stricter validation, and make your document readable by XML parsers,
    please close all HTML elements.

    -   HTML Tip: Use Lowercase Tags

        HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
        The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C 
        recommends lowercase in HTML4, and demands lowercase for 
        stricter document types like XHTML.

        At W3Schools we always use lowercase tags.
