-   Reduce Activity in Loops

    Loops are often used in programming.

    Every statement inside a loop will be executed for
    each iteration of the loop. Search for statement or
    assignments that can be placed outside the loop.

-   Reduce DOM(Document Object Model) Access

    Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript
    statements. If you expect to access a DOM element several times,
    access it once, and use it as local variable:

    For example:

    obj = document.getElementById("demo");
    obj.innerHTML = "Hello";

-   Reduce DOM size

    Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small.
    This will always improve page loading, and speed up rendering
    , especially on smaller devices. Every attempt to search the
    DOM(like getElementsByTarName) will benefit from a smaller DOM.

-   Avoid Uncessary Variables

    Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save values.

    For example: you can replace the folloing code:

    var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;

    with this:

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName

-   Delay JavaScript Loading

    Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body, lets the browser
    load the page first. 

    While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other
    downloads. In addition all parsing and rendering activity might
    be blocked. 

    Note: The HTTP specification defines that browser should not download
    more than two components in parallel.

    An alternative is to sue defer="true" in the script tag. The defer
    attribute specifies that the script should be executed before the page
    has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.

    If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page
    has loaded:

    Example:

    window.onload = downScripts;

    function downScripts() {
        var element = document.createElement("scripts");
        element.src = "myScript.js";
        document.body.appendChild(element);
    }
    
-   Avoid Using with (??)

    Avoid using the with keyword. It has a negative effect on speed. 
    It also clutters up JavaScript scopes. The with keyword is not 
    allowed in strict mode
