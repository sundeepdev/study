/*
    Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript
    will misunderstand this string:

    var y = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."

    The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called". The solution
    is to use \escape character. Here is the list of special characters:

    \'	single quote
    \"	double quote
    \\	backslash
    \n	new line
    \r	carriage return
    \t	tab
    \b	backspace
    \f	form feed
*/

var x = 'It\'s alright'
var y = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + "<br>" + y;
