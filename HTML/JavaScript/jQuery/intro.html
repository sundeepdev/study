    There are a couple javaScript libraries for you such as jQuery, 
    Prototype, MooTools and so on.

    All of these frameworks have functions for common JavaScript tasks like
    animation, DOM manipulation, and Ajax handling.

    jQuery is the most popular javaScript framework on the Internet today.
    It uses CSS selectors to access and manipulate HTML elements
    (DOM Objects) on a web page. jQuery also provides a companion UI(user
    interface) framework and numerous other plug-ins.

    The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

    jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to
    accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line
    of code. 

    jQuery also simplifies a lots of the complicated things from JavaScrpt, like AJAX calls
    and DOM manipulation.

    The jQuery library contains the following features:

        -   HTML/DOM manipulation
        -   CSS manipulation
        -   HTML event methods
        -   Effects and Animations
        -   AJAX
        -   Utilities

    -   CDN - Content Delivery Networks

    You always want your web pages to be as fast as possible. You want to
    keep the size of your pages as small as possible, and you want the
    browser to cache as much as possible.

    -   Before you decide to use a JavaScript framework, it might be a
        good idea to test the framework first. 

        JavaScript frameworks are very easy to test.

    -   jQuery Described

        The main jQuery function is the $() function (the jQuery function).
        If you pass DOM objects to this function, it returns jQuery object,
        with jQuery functionality added to them.

        jQuery allows you to select elements by CSS selectors.

        In JavaScript, you can assign a function to handle the window's
        load event: 

        In JavaScript, you can assign a function to handle the window's load event:

        The JavaScript Way:

        function myFunction() {
            var obj = document.getElementById("h01");
            obj.innerHTML = "Hello jQuery";
        }
        onload = myFunction;

        The jQuery equivalent is different:

        function myFunction() {
            $("#h01").html("Hello jQuery");
        }
        $(document).ready(myFunction);

        The last line of the code above, passes the HTML DOM document object to jQuery: $(document).
        When you pass DOM objects to jQuery, jQuery returns new jQuery objects wrapped around HTML DOM objects.
        The jQuery function returns a new jQuery object, where ready() is a method.
