    jQuery - AJAX Introduction

    AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts
    of a web page - without reloading the whole page.

    AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

    In short, AJAX is about loading data in the background and display it
    on the webpage, without reloading the whole page.

    Examples of applications using AJAX: Gmail, Google Maps, Youtube, and
    Facebook tabs(??)

    -   What About jQuery and AJAX?

    jQuery provides several methods for AJAX functionality.

    With the jQuery AJAX methods, you can request text, HTML, XML
    , or JSON from a remote server using both HTTP Get and HTTP 
    Post - And you can load the external data directly into the 
    selected HTML elements of your web page!

    Without jQuery, AJAX coding can be a bit tricky!

    Writing regular AJAX code can be a bit tricky, because different 
    browsers have different syntax for AJAX implementation. This means 
    that you will have to write extra code to test for different browsers. 
    However, the jQuery team has taken care of this for us, so that we 
    can write AJAX functionality with only one single line of code.

    -   jQuery load() Method

    jQuery load() method is a simple but powerful AJAX method.
    The load() method loads data from a server and puts the returned data
    into the selected element.

    Syntax:

    $(selector).load(URL, data, callback);

    The required URL parameter specifies the URL you wish to load.

    The optional data parameter specifies a set of querystring key/value pairs to send along with the request.

    The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed after the load() method is completed.
