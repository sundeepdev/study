    With jQuery, you can chain together action/methods

    Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same element) within a single statement.

    Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the other).

    However, there is a technique called chaining, that allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same element(s).

    Tip: This way, browsers do not have to find same element(s) more than once.

    To chain an action, you simply append the action to the previous action.

    The following example together the css(), slideUp(), and slideDown() methods. The "p1" element first changes to red, then it slides up, and
    then it slides down:

*/
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $("#p1").css("color","red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
  });
});

<p id="p1">jQuery is fun!!</p>
<button>Click me</button>
