    Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

    -   A $ sign to define/access jQuery
    -   A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
    -   A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

    Examples:

    $(this).hide() - hides the current element.
    $("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
    $(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test"
    $("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

    You might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are
    inside a document ready event:

    $(document).ready(function()) {
        //jQuery methods go here...
    }

    This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document
    is finished loading. It is good practice to wait for the document
    to be fully loaded and ready before working with it. This also allows
    you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in
    the head section(??).

    Here are some examples of actions that can fail if methods are run
    before the document is fully loaded:
    
    -   Trying to hide an element that is not created yet.
    -   Trying to get the size of an image that is not loaded yet.
    
    Tip: The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for
    the document ready event:

    $(function(){
        //jQuery methods go here...
    });

    Use the syntax you prefer. We think that the document ready event
    is easier to understand when reading the code.

    -   Functions In a Seperate File

        If your website contains a lot of pages, and you want your jQuery functions to be easy
        to maintain, you can put your jQuery functions in a seperate .js file

        e.g.

        src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js">
