/*
    The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5(ECMAScript
    version 5). It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored
    by earlier version of JavaScript. The purpose of "use strict" is
    to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". With
    strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

    Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning
    of a JavaScript file, or a JavaScript function. Declared at the
    beginning of a JavaScript file, it has global scope(all code will
    execute in strict mode). Declared inside a function, it has local
    scope(only the code inside the function is in strict mode).

    Why Strict Mode? Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure"
    Javascript. Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax"
    into real error. In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable 
    property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a 
    non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.

    Note: The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning
    of a script or a function.
