/*
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search
pattern.

Syntax:

/pattern/modifiers;

Using String search() with a regular expression:

-   The search() method uses an expression to search for a match
    , and returns the position of the match.

-   The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern
    is replaced.

For example:

var str = "Visit W3Schools";
var n = str.search(/w3schools/i);

-   Regular Expression Modifiers

    Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches:

    Modifier    Description
    i           Perform case-insensitive matching
    g           Perform a global match(find all matches rather than stopping
                after the first match)
    m           Perform multiline matching

-   Regular Expression Patterns

    Brackets are used to find a range of characters:

    Expression  Description
    [abc]       Find any of the characters between the brackets
    [0-9]       Find any of the digits between the brackets
    (x|y)       Find any of the alternatives separated with |

-   Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

    Metacharacter   Description
    \d              Find a digit
    \s              Find a whitespace character
    \b              Find a match at the beginning or at the end of a word
    \uxxx           Find the Unicode character specified by the hex number xxx
-   Quantifiers define quantities:

    Quantifier      Description
    n+              Matches any string that contains at least one n
    n*              Matches any string that contains zero or more
                    occurences of n
    n?              Matches any string that contains zero or one
                    occurences of n

-   Using the RegExp Object

    In JavaScript, the RegExp object is a regular expression object with
    predefined properties and methods

-   Using test()

    The test() method is a RegExp expression method.
    It searches a string for a pattern, and returns true or false, 
    depending on the result. The following example searches a string
    for the character "e":

    var patt = /e/;
    patt.test("The best things in life are free!");

-   Using exec()

    The exec() method is a RegExp expression method.
    It searches a string for a specified pattern, and returns the found
    text. If no match is found, it returns null. The following example
    searches a string for the character "e":

    /e/.exec("The best things in life are free!");

    The output will be: e
