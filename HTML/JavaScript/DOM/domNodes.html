<p>Hello World</p>
<div>
<p>The DOM is very useful!</p>
<p>This example demonstrates the <b>document.body</b> property.</p>
</div>

<script>

/*
    -   The entire document is a document node
    -   Every HTML element is an element node
    -   The text inside HTML elements are text nodes
    -   Every HTML attribute is an attribute node
    -   All comments are comment nodes

-   Node Relations

    The nodes in the node tree have a hierachical relationship
    to each other. The terms parent, child, and sibling are
    used to describe the relationships.

    -   In a node tree, the top node is called the root
    -   Every node has exactly one parent, except the root
    -   A node can have a number of children
    -   Siblings are nodes with the same parent

    Example:

    <html>
        <head>
          <title>DOM Tutorial</title>
        </head>
    </html>

    <body>
      <h1>DOM Lesson one</h1>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </body>

    From the HTML above you can read:

    -   <html> is the root node
    -   <html> has no parents
    -   <html> is the parent of <head> and <body>
    -   <head> is the first child of <html>
    -   <body> is the last child of <html>

    and:

    -   <head> has one child: <title>
    -   <title> has one child(a text node): "DOM Tutorial"
    -   <body> has two children: <h1> and <p>
    -   <h1> has one child: "DOM Lesson one"
    -   <p> has one child:"Hello world!"
    -   <h1> and <p> are siblings

-   Navigating Between Nodes

    You can use the following node properties to navigate between
    nodes with JavaScript:

    -   parentNode
    -   childNodes[nodenumber]
    -   firstChild
    -   lastChild
    -   nextSibling
    -   previousSibling

-   Warning !

    A common error in DOM processing is to expect an element node
    to contain text.

    In this example: <title>DOM Tutorial</title>, the element node
    <title> does not contain text. It contains a text node with
    the value "DOM Tutorial".

    The value of the text node can be accessed by the node's innerHTML
    property or the nodeValue

    In addition to the innerHTML property, you can also use the
    childNodes and nodeValue properties to get the content of an element.

-   DOM Root Nodes

    There are two special properties that allow access to the full document:

    -   document.body - The body of the document
    -   document.documentElement - The full document

-   The nodeName property

    The nodeName property specifies the name of a node

    -   nodeName is read-only
    -   nodeName of an element node is the same as the tag name
    -   nodeName of an attribute node is the attribute name
    -   nodeName of a text node is always #text
    -   nodeName of the document node is always #document

    Note: nodeValue always contains the uppercase tag name of an HTML element.

-   The nodeValue property

    The nodeValue property specifies the value of a node.

    -   nodeValue for element nodes is undefined
    -   nodeValue for text nodes is the text itself
    -   nodeValue for attribute node is the attribute value

-   The nodeType property

    The nodeType property returns the type of node. nodeType is read only
    The most important node types are:

    Element Type        NodeType
    Element             1
    Attribute           2
    Text                3
    Comment             8
    Document            9

var myText = document.getElementById("intro").childNodes[0].nodeValue;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myText;

alert(document.body.innerHTML);
