/*
    Using Events

    The HTML DOM allows you to execute code when an event occurs.
    Events are generated by the browser when "things" happen to HTML
    elements

    -   An element is clicked on
    -   The page has loaded
    -   Input fields are changed

    A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like whena user
    clicks on an HTML element. To execute code when a user clicks on
    an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:

    onclick=JavaScript

    Examples of HTML events:

    -   When a user clicks the mouse
    -   When a web page has loaded
    -   When an image has been loaded
    -   When the mouse moves over an element
    -   When an input field is changed
    -   When an HTML form is submitted
    -   When a user strokes a key

    The onload and onunload Events

    The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.
    The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version,
    and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.
