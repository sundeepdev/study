    When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object
    Model of the page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of
    Objects:

                            Document
                                |
                            Root element:
                              <html>
                                |
                ------------------------------------
                |                                   |
            Element                                 Element:
            <head>                                  <body>
                |                                   |
            Element:                          |------------|
            <title>             Attribute ---Element:   Element:
               |                    "href"   <a>         <h1>
              Text:                           |            |
            "My title"                       Text:        Text:
                                            "My link"   "My header"

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that 
allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and 
style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is seperated into 3 different parts:

-   CORE DOM:   standard model for all document types
-   XML DOM:    standard model for XML documents
-   HTML DOM:   standard model for HTML documents

What is HTML DOM?

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines: 

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
