/*
    All modern browsers have built-in debugger. Built-in debuggers
    can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the
    user. With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints, and examine
    variables while the code is executing.

    If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to
    display JavaScript values in the debugger window. (In Chrome
    browser, press F12)

    -   Setting Breakpoints

        In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript
        code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and
        let you examine JavaScript values. AFter examing values, you can
        resume the execution of code(typically with a play button)

    -   The debugger keyword

        The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls
        (if available) the debugging function. This has the same function
        as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.
