In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to
the top of the current stope(to the top of the current script or the 
current function). JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior
of JavaScript. If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs
may contain bugs(errors). To avoid bugs, always declare all variables
at the beginning of every scope. Since this is how JavaScript interprets
the code, it is always a good rule.

var x = 5;

elem = document.getElementById("demo"); //Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x + " " + y; //declaration is hoisted but the value is undefined.

var y = 7; //initialization is not hoisted
