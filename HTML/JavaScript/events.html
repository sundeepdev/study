    An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something
    a user does. Here are some examples of HTML events:

    -   An HTML web page has finished loading
    -   An HTML input field was changed
    -   An HTML button was clicked

    JavaScrpt lets you execute code when events are detected.

    HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code,
    With single quotes:

    <some-HTML-element some-event='some javascript'>

    With double quotes:

    <some-HTML-element some-event="some javascript">

    With a calling function:

    <some-HTML-element some-event="function">
    
    Common HTML Events:

    onchange        An HTML element has been changed
    onclick         The user clicks an HTML element
    onmouseover     The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
    onmouseout      The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
    onkeydown       The user pushes a keyboard key
    onload          The browser has finished loading the page

    The list is much longer:
