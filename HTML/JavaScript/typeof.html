    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type
    of a JavaScript variable

    typeof "John"                // Returns string 
    typeof 3.14                  // Returns number
    typeof false                 // Returns boolean
    typeof [1,2,3,4]             // Returns object
    typeof {name:'John', age:34} // Returns object

    -   Null

        Null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't
        exist. Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is
        an object.

        You can empty an object by setting it to null:

        var person = null;

        You can also empty an object by setting it to undefined:

        var person = undefined; //Value is underfined, type is underfined.

    -   Undefined

        In JsvaScript, undefined is a variable with no value.
        The typeof a variable with no value is also undefined.

        var person;     //Value is undefined, type is undefined.

        Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. 
        The type will also be undefined. 
        person = undefined;

        Difference Between Undefined and Null

        typeof undefined    //undefined
        typeof null         //object
        null === undefined  //false
        null == undefined   //true

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
typeof undefined + "<br>" +
typeof null + "<br>" +
(null === undefined) + "<br>" +
(null == undefined);
