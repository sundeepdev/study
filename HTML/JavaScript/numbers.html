    JavaScript numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
    var x = 34.00; // A number with decimals
    var y = 34; //A number without decimals

    extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific
    (exponent) notation:

    var x = 123e5;  //12300000
    var y = 123e-5; //0.00123

    JavaScript Numbers are always 64-bit Floating Point

    Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript numbers are always
    stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the
    IEEE 754 standard. This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where 
    the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent 
    in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63.

    Infinity(-Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you 
    calculate a number outside the largest possible number.
     
    Division by 0 also generates Infinith:

    var x = 2 / 0: //x will be Infinity   
    var y = -2 / 0: //y will be -Infinity

    NaN - Not a Number

    It is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a value is not a 
    number. Trying to do arighmetic with a non-numeric string will
    result in NaN(Not a Number)

    var x = 100 / "Apple"; //x will be NaN (Not a Number)

    However, if the string contains a numeric value, the result will
    be a number:

    var x = 100 / "10"; //x will be 10

    Number properties belongs to the JavaScript's number object wrapper
    called Number. These properties can only by accessed as 
    Number.MAX_VALUE. Using myNumber.MAX_VALUE, where myNumber is a
    variable, expression, or value, will return undefined.

    var x = 6;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x.MAX_VALUE;
